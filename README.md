## Description

**Push_swap** is a project developed by 42School to challenge students' algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills. The objective is to create a program that sorts a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. Students manipulate two stacks, A and B, using operations like swapping, pushing, and rotating to achieve a sorted arrangement. They must devise an **efficient sorting algorithm**, considering various stack sizes and optimizing for minimal operations. Push_swap enhances students' understanding of sorting algorithms, algorithm design, and programming skills. It encourages critical thinking and fosters their growth as skilled programmers.

## Usage

``make`` to compile all the functions.
